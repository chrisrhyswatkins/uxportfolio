				<h2 class="sub-section">The Brief</h2>
				<p class="portfolio-body nothing-below">While UX designers are sometimes able to redesign or imagine entire products or systems, often the changes that can be made are much smaller in scope. In this exercise, we were individually tasked with using our current knowledge of visual and interactive principles to redesign the visual layout of an existing product website. However, the programming and semantic markup for the page was locked (with slight positional flexibility dependent on sound reasoning), so only changes that alter elements that are already on the page were permitted.</p>

I decided to evaluate the design given in accordance with the visual and interactive principles outlined by the work of Alan Cooper and Paul Benyon, identifying each element or aspect of the design which violated these principles, and additional issues observed not addressed specifically within these principles, and created an annotated overview of the design to outline the issues found.</p>

				    	<a href="#" class="accordion-title">Problems Identified</a>
				    	<div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
				      		<ol class="regular">
								<li><p>While the â€˜Get Backup and Sync for Macâ€™ option looks visually unappealing, it's position is also unsuitable in terms of it's distance from the element it relates to, the â€˜Backupsâ€™ menu option.</p></li>
					      		<li><p>The method of displaying the storage usage, whilst informative, does technically require a calculative effort on the part of the user to work out the amount remaining.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The arrows to the left of the menu items â€˜My Driveâ€™ and â€˜Computersâ€™ go some way to violating the rule of familiarity to the users, who are more likely to be used to seeing collapsable menu items with an icon to the right of the text label.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>To less familiar users, the visibility and navigation possibilities of the menu options to the left of the screen may be overlooked initially due to the lack of visual separation between these options, and the content of the current folder displayed in the middle of the screen.</p></li>
					      		<li><p>The blue â€˜NEWâ€™ button displayed in the left hand screen creates confusion to itâ€™s function due to it's position in relation to the elements it targets, and also the vagueness of language.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The arrow next to the userâ€™s current location, â€˜My Driveâ€™, lacks sufficient semiotic value in conveying itâ€™s true function.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The direction of the arrow to convey the order in which the folders and files are currently displayed appears to go against logic and countless systems that users will be used to. Additionally, there is no clear indication of which column the items are currently being sorted by.</p></li>
					      		<li><p>There is a lack of differentiation between what is essentially two separate navigation bars, but displayed as one, causing large issues with visual and information hierarchy, and separation of action functionality.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The current notifications icon (the bell next to the userâ€™s profile image) violates the consistency present in the majority of the other icons displayed on the screen.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The location of the settings call to action could cause confusion in the mind of the user as to it's actual functionality.</p></li>
					      		<li><p>There is no conveyance of function of the information icon through visual indication, through position or appearance. This element needs attention at two points: a) itâ€™s position must better convey itâ€™s function in relation to the currently selected file, folder, or location, and b) the system needs to better draw attention of the user to the important event of the information/details/activity sidebar being opened or closed with itâ€™s click.</p></li>
					          	<li><p>The current option for the user to alter the view type of the files and folders shown can cause confusion to itâ€™s similarity in appearance to the Drive option directly above it, and also itâ€™s spacial relativity to that same option.</p></li>

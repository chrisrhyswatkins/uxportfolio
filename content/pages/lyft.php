				<p class="portfolio-body nothing-below">Lyft is one of the world’s largest transportation companies, facilitating over one million rides per day in up to 300 US cities, despite owning no fleet of vehicles. One of the most important aspects of Lyft’s service is the qualified and accurate ratings from users, although the current five-star system’s limitations tacitly encourage users to rank their driver using only very good or very bad rankings. Our goal was to create a replacement for the current rating system that Lyft uses, considering the ways various rating systems constrain the input of users, the ease of use in urban environments, and the ways in which this information could be used maliciously against drivers.</p>

Taking these design changes in to account in the design iteration, we conducted our first round of testing with users.<p>
				<p class="portfolio-body nothing-below">Using a paper prototype, each of the four participants recruited were given the scenario of a user who had just had a ride that matched some of the preferences selected, but was not necessarily fantastic or terrible. With one facilitator giving the scenario, and then acting as the ‘computer’ manipulating the paper prototype dependent on user actions, we were able to gain valuable insights through observations, and asking the participant to incorporate a think-aloud protocol, but only requesting free-flowing thoughts as to not increase cognitive load.</p>

				<p class="capitalized-title-desc above-list-items">Key Issues Found In Testing Round #1</p>

					<li><p>The sad emoji used on the initial “good or bad” rating prompt screen did not accurately reflect some participant’s emotions when actually having a bad ride. “I’m not really sad when I’ve had a bad ride, I’m more angry.”</p></li>
		      		<li><p>Confusion regarding preferences, some of which was out of the lack of context in the way that Mirror works, other due to confusion/lack of visual cues, notably the three dots to the right of the preferences. Similar issues also persisted with participants not being sure why certain items were selected and some were not, again as they didn’t know these were supposed to be preferences.</p></li>
		          	<li><p>Some participants did not recognize the ability to change the option of a good or bad rating on the second screen using the emojis in the upper right corner of the screen. They mentioned that it looked more like a “scale bar” rather than options to change the rating attitude.</p></li>
		          	<li><p>One participant asked how they would find out the driver’s score, as well as how well they match up with the selected preferences. Again, this relates to the lack of context as to the process users go through before entering the vehicle.</p>

				<p class="portfolio-body nothing-below">With the findings of the previous round of testing analyzed and addressed in another design iteration of a higher fidelity, the team incorporated the same method in the second round of testing. However, the changes to the design introduced a number of new screens that walked the user through the initial onboarding and preference selection process, as well as searching for a ride and being matched with a driver, with the hope that the rating process would be better understood with this added context. Again, four participants unfamiliar to the project were recruited, and through testing the team found that the new process walking the participant through the preference selection and ride search process, appeared to eliminate much of the confusion shown in previous testing during the rating process.</p>
				<!--
				<p class="capitalized-title-desc above-list-items">Key Issues Found In Testing Round #2</p>
				<ol class="regular">
					<li><p>One participant noted that it may be helpful to give the option to learn more about the process from the initial rating prompt screen, and how the ratings affect a driver’s score. This was actually noted by the team in the initial usability inspection, but had not been rectified up until this point.</p></li>
		          	<li><p>One user asked what would happen theoretically if they had ‘blocked’ most of the drivers within their area. The member of the team conducting the test explained that although users would have the option to unblock drivers in the application preferences, they would also be prompted by the application when searching for a ride to potentially unblock drivers if there were no more unblocked drivers available in the area.</p></li>

				<p class="portfolio-body">Once the user has set their pickup location and destination, they will be presented with the option to search for a Lyft ASAP (the current search method), or the proposed Lyft Mirror method. First time users of this option will be taken through the onboarding process, selecting up to two preferences they wish for their ride to meet, covering a range of categories from conversation level and music, to amenities available during the trip. These options allow the user to tailor their ride dependent on their mood, or the situation, whether heading home after an exhaustingly long day, or heading to the bars with friends. These preferences are saved to the users account, but they can temporarily change the preferences for each ride, or change them within their account to be saved.</p>

				<h2 class="sub-section">Matching &amp; Confirming a Driver</h2>
				<p class="portfolio-body">After using Lyft Mirror to search for a ride closely matching the preferences selected, the system will search the local surroundings to find the driver most closely matching those preferences. Naturally, this may not be the closest rider available, so if in a rush, the user may at this time switch to instead search for a close driver, or instead move to the next match. The user is given 60 seconds to confirm the match, after which the request will be cancelled. It is worth noting at this time, that the star rating applied to drivers has been replaced with a level-up concept. A positive ride will award the driver 1 point, while a negative ride will take away 3 points, with more points being required by the driver to progress up each level. This positive or negative rating concept will become clearer in the next section.</p>

				<h2 class="sub-section">Leaving a Positive Rating</h2>
				<p class="portfolio-body">Upon the completion of a ride, the user is no longer asked to provide a potentially inaccurate, and unrepresentative verdict of their experience. Instead they now simply have to match their emotion to the vastly differing visual options available, becoming more of a recognized visceral reaction rather than a recalled calculative effort. If positive, the user proceeds to recognizing and selecting the positive aspects of their ride (the selections in both positive and negative sections help to build up the profile of the driver, influencing the match system). It’s worth noting that if a driver matched based on a preference being over a certain level in their own match system, say 75%, then that preference will be initially selected, but can be deselected by the user.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-body">Even if the ride was deemed positive by the user, it doesn’t mean that everything is perfect, and every piece of feedback is valuable to both the driver for performance improvement, and Lyft as a company. This means that users can now acknowledge any negative aspects of the ride, but without putting the driver at risk of deactivation through a less than perfect rating. The user is also able to add their own critique, if not available in the predefined list.</p>

				<h2 class="sub-section">Leaving a Negative Rating</h2>
				<p class="portfolio-body">The process of leaving a negative rating for a ride works much in the same way as when leaving a positive rating, but with some key differences. Firstly, the list of potentially negative aspects of the ride to select are requested from the user first, to allow for the recognition that the company is prioritizing their emotions and understanding what made their experience negative. When proceeding to the potentially positive aspects of the ride, the system is dynamic in the sense that the options displayed in this second stage depend greatly on those selected in the first. For example, if the user selects ‘dirty vehicle’ in the negative section, the option of the vehicle being ‘squeaky clean’ will obviously not be available to define as a positive aspect.</p>
				<p class="portfolio-body">The user is also able to give additional comments in the final stage of the rating process, and in order to address the issue where riders would be afraid to give negative ratings out of the fear of matching with that driver again in the future, the user now has the option to ‘block’ a driver, meaning they cannot match with that driver again. The user would of course be able to unblock any drivers within their settings.</p>
